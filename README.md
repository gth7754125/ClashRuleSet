# ClashRuleSet

------------



Self-Use rules for Clash.

  It writes according to the grammar of `rule-provider`.
  Using rule-provider to match rules can be faster than the `classical-behaviour`.



#### Rules Matches Priority

**[Recommend Order:]**  **Area Limited(JP/TW only) > Streaming(Netflix/Youtube) > Proxy(for sites banned) > DIRECT>IP-cidr>GEOIP**

Some Services needed to be taken apart for more flexible proxy-line of area changed, such as Apple(Music/TV), Netflix and other region limited services...

Domestic rules donâ€™t match any Apple Services for people who use foreign region services, otherwise it may lead to login failure.
